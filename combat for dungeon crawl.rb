#combat
#the intent here is to pole the various attributes of the player and the creature
#in this version we assume the creature class has 3 main attributes
# attack, health, and speed
#who ever has the higher speed gets to go first in combat
#creatures then take turns doing damage until one creature is defeated 
def combat (creature_speed, player_speed)
	if player_speed > creature_speed
		#player does damage first
